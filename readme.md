Using http://api.giphy.com:

* Once the Giphy API has responded with data, append the GIF to the page
* Allow the user to search for as many GIFs as they would like and keep appending them to the page
* Allow the user to remove all of the GIFs by clicking a button
* Here is an example of what the application might look like:
